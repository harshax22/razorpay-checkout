## Razorpay Checkout

This repository provides a demonstration of Razorpay Standard Checkout and processes transactions in all of Razorpay's Supported Currencies. 

### Usage

This project is deployed live at https://razorpay-checkout-22.herokuapp.com/ and it asks for 3 parameters to open the checkout - currency, API Key and the amount. 
Please pass these values to the input fields and click on the button to open the checkout.
 
Currency - USD

API Key - rzp_test_IFMmoKlMshyTeL

Amount - This can be any valid value, the minimum value would be 0.5(cents)

The above API Key is a test API Key and hence no real transaction would take place. If you would want to perform a live transaction please use this live API Key - rzp_live_3DKO7MWrGOABKd

### Note

If you wish to perform a live transaction using the live API Key please note that the amount you chose to pay would be auto-refunded back to your account after 5 days from the date of transaction without any deductions so nothing to lose :)
